# Spotify API Clone

A REST API for a Spotify-like music application. Supports two microservices: profiles and songs. 
For the profile microservice, apps are able to call the API to create, remove, profiles and friend, follow other profiles. 
Apps can also like/unlike songs to add/remove it from their playlist. 
For the song microservice, apps can create, delete songs and query for songs.
By using microservices to handle the profile and song systems, it allows for greater extensibility to the API.
